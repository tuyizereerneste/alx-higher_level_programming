0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

TASKS:

1. Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”.

2. Write a script that prints 3 lines:

The first line: “C is fun”
The second line: “Python is cool”
The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
You must use console.log(...) to print all output.

3. Write a script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:

If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
Otherwise, print “Arguments found”.

4. Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:

If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”.

5. Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”

6. Write a script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer:

If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Not a number”

7. Write a script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop

The first line: “C is fun”
The second line: “Python is cool”
The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
You must use console.log(...) to print all output
You are not allowed to use var
You are not allowed to use any if/else statement
You can use only one console.log
You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

8. Write a script that prints x times “C is fun”

Where x is the first argument of the script
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”.

9. Write a script that prints a square

The first argument is the size of the square
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
You must use the character X to print the square.

10. Write a script that prints the addition of 2 integers

The first argument is the first integer
The second argument is the second integer
You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b).

11. Write a script that computes and prints a factorial

The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial
Factorial of NaN is 1
You must do it recursively

12. Write a script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.

You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer
If no argument passed, print 0
If the number of arguments is 1, print 0

13. Write a function that returns the addition of 2 integers.

The function must be visible from outside
The name of the function must be add
You are not allowed to use var.
