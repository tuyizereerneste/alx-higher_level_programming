0x0B. Python - Input/Output

TASKS:

1. Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:

2. Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written

3. Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added

4. Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)

5. Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string

6. Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation

7. Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”

8. Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file:

You must use your function save_to_json_file from 5-save_to_json_file.py
You must use your function load_from_json_file from 6-load_from_json_file.py
The list must be saved as a JSON representation in a file named add_item.json
If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created

9. Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure
(list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object

10. Write a class Student that defines a student by:

Public instance attributes:
first_name
last_name
age
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py

11. Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py)

Public instance attributes:
first_name
last_name
age
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self, attrs=None): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py):
If attrs is a list of strings, only attribute names contained in this list must be retrieved.
Otherwise, all attributes must be retrieved

12. Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 10-student.py)

Public instance attributes:
first_name
last_name
age
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self, attrs=None): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py):
If attrs is a list of strings, only attributes name contain in this list must be retrieved.
Otherwise, all attributes must be retrieved
Public method def reload_from_json(self, json): that replaces all attributes of the Student instance:
You can assume json will always be a dictionary
A dictionary key will be the public attribute name
A dictionary value will be the value of the public attribute

12. Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:

Returns an empty list if n <= 0
You can assume n will be always an integer
You are not allowed to import any module
