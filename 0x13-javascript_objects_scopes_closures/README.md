0x13 - Javascript Objects Scopes Closures

TASKS:

1. Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle

2. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

	You must use the class notation for defining your class
	The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
	Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
	Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h

3. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

	You must use the class notation for defining your class
	The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
	Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
	Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
	If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object

4. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

	If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
	Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X

5. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

	If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
	Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X
	Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
	Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2

6. Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:

	You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
	The constructor must take 1 argument: size
	The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super())

7. Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js:
	Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c
		If c is undefined, use the character X

8. Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list:

	Prototype: exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement)

9. Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list:

	Prototype: exports.esrever = function (list)

10. Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

11. Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument
	Prototype: exports.converter = function (base)
